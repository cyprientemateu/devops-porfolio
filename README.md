📄 README — Project 1: CI/CD Pipeline to EC2 with Terraform, Ansible, Docker, Nginx
# Project 1 — CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions → EC2 Deployment

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates a full DevOps deployment workflow using:
- Terraform for infrastructure provisioning (EC2, Security Groups, IAM)
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD automation
- Docker for application packaging
- Ansible for configuration & deployment
- Nginx as a reverse proxy

The pipeline automatically:
1. Builds and pushes a Docker image to DockerHub
2. Deploys infrastructure using Terraform
3. Connects to the EC2 instance via SSH
4. Pulls the Docker image and runs the container
5. Configures Nginx to expose the application

📝 4. 20 DevOps Interview Q&A (Strong Answers)
1. What happens when you push code to a CI/CD pipeline?
A pipeline should lint, build, test, scan for vulnerabilities, package the app, push to registry, and deploy.

2. Explain the difference between Terraform state and plan.
State tracks real infrastructure.
Plan shows the changes Terraform will apply.

3. How does Kubernetes achieve high availability?
ReplicaSets, automatic rescheduling, self-healing, and node replacement.

4. What is the purpose of an IAM role?
Grant permissions to AWS services without storing credentials.

5. What is a reverse proxy?
A server that routes requests to backend services (example: Nginx).

6. Why use Docker instead of running code directly?
Consistency, portability, reproducible environments.

7. What is the difference between a Deployment and a StatefulSet?
Deployment = stateless pods
StatefulSet = persistent identity + storage

8. How does a load balancer improve reliability?
Distributes traffic, health checks, removes unhealthy instances.

9. What is infrastructure as code?
Managing cloud infrastructure through declarative files like Terraform.

10. Why do we use S3 backend for Terraform state?
Remote storage + locking + team collaboration.

11. Explain blue-green deployment.
Two environments (blue/green). Switch traffic only when green is ready.

12. What is HPA?
K8s Horizontal Pod Autoscaler scales based on CPU or metrics.

13. What does kubectl apply do?
Creates or updates resources declaratively.

14. How does Prometheus scrape metrics?
Pulls metrics from exporters on HTTP endpoints.

15. Why is least privilege important?
Reduces security risk by minimizing access.

16. Difference between public subnet and private subnet?
Public has route to Internet Gateway.
Private goes through NAT gateway.

17. What is the purpose of a NAT gateway?
Let private subnet instances access the internet without exposing them.

18. Why use modules in Terraform?
Reusability, organization, and less duplication.

19. What is container orchestration?
Automatic lifecycle management of containers (deploy, scale, heal).

20. What is Git rebase?
Rewrites history to create a cleaner linear commit history.
